This week we talked about creditability and validity.

Creditability is about how truthworthy is a piece of information, where is the information came out from is a key factor to determine whether it is creditable. For example, I would believe information reported by well known broadasting station in the headline news or what a professional said. The information we found on Internet is not very creditable because it may just came out from a nobody who heard other people said. For academic paper, the writer has to include references and citations if he wants to use the findings or to quote what other people had said, the information he found is from the more creditable resource which are published books and reports etc. Who did the research also gives am impression of how creditable is the paper, if the research is done by an university student for school assessment, he might find information from the Internet which some maybe right and some maybe not, the creditability is not so high; if the research is done by an university professor or researcher for a serious academic paper, he would tend to find information from more reliable resource, and he might also have knowledge in that area, the creditability is higher.

Validity is how likely the information is true, I would believe physical evidences like photos and videos, or a logical inference of the causes and consequences. Witnesses may lie about things so they can only be the secondary proof of the physical evidences, the physical evidences are still more convining for me. To justify whether the information is valid, first we need to distinguish whether this is opinion or fact; opinion with bias is not valid to proof whether this is true or not, but a fact which have done comprehensive experiment to prove or a scientific survey between groups of stakeholders to find out the trend or the major perference ove an issue is valid.
