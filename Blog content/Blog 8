This week we did a recap of the previous thing we have learnt. We evaluated the information sources we can get, how formal are they and how trustworthy are they.

Start from the informal side, we as a student, we always look for information from the Internet, the website we go maybe from the blogs written by people in this industry, and we usually learn from Youtude tutorials, these sources sometimes has very useful information, but they are classified as very informal information. Wikipedia is also an informal information, since everyone can edit the content in Wikipedia, the content might be wrong. Public survey and the journals in magazine kind of in the middle but more on the informal side, these surveys may sum up the general phenomenons, but that may be affected by the selected target group, so the result probably with bias.

For the information sources which are half informal half formal, newspaper and documentries are more formal than what I had mentioned above. The content of these sources requires people to be in the location to collect evidents or to give reasonable assumption based on scientific logics. The learning sources like Coursera and Udemy, and the white papers from Google, Mircosoft, and IBM etc, these information is collected by a big team of people, the content is analysed carefully to maintain the quality.

For the formal information, the research survey is a proper research which done by professional people, they will gather information from other academic books with proper information gathering methodology, analyse information to draw systematic comcludsion. Also, the peer-reviewed research paper is also a very formal information source, the peer-reviewed paper is a team of professional people to review the academic paper written by another team of profession people, if the paper is approved by the reviewers, which mean the content of that academic paper is very legit and reliable.
