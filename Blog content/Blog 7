This week we do a academic paper research exercise.

Article 1
Title and author(s) of the article
Title: The Virtual Reality Lab: Realization and Application of Virtual Sound Environments
Author: Volker Hohmann,Richard Paluch, Melanie Krueger, Markus Meis, and Giso Grimm

APA reference
Hohmann, V., Paluch, R., Krueger, M., Meis, M., & Grimm, G. (2020). The Virtual Reality Lab: Realization and application of virtual sound environments. Ear and Hearing, 41(Suppl 1), 31S.

How you found the article and what keywords you used
I typed in "Virtual reality" keyword in Google Scholar.

What kind of article it is
Experimental report

All the reasons that you think it is an academic article
I think this is an academic article because the research is done in the virtual reality lab in Oldenburg University, a research done in a lab in a university sounds very professional for me, only the professional people in this field want to get a reality result so they are willing to pay for doing the experiment in a virtual reality lab in a university. This article used a lot of references and citations, a servious academic article would need to do a lot of research from other places, that's why there are so many referces and citations, and the way how the article is written seems like a professional academic article for me. This article had been published, so I believe this is an academic article.

How well it fits the ‘structure of an academic article’ that I described in my previous post
This article quite fit the structure of an academic article, it has tiltle, abstract, introduction, the content of the research and what they did, the result of what they did, a conclusion and the reference list. The thing which missed out are the review of other paper related to this topic and a discussion of what the result means.

How many references it has
It has 51 references.

How many citations it has
It has quite a lot citations inside the article.

Say whether you are interested in properly reading the article or not
I am not interested in reading this article. I would like to look for something in the virtual reality technology field, the development of this technology, how to create this kind of virtual reality game, a review of what this technology been used nowaday etc, but not a hearing experiment done in a virtual reality lab, it was not the thing that I look for at the beginning, so I am not going to read it. The content of this paper seems boring too, for people who are interested in science may want to read it but not for me.


Article 2
Title and author(s) of the article
Title: Privacy Preserving Face Recognition Utilizing Differential Privacy
Authors: M.A.P.ChamikaraabP.BertokaI.KhalilaD.LiubS.Camtepe

How you found the article and what keywords you used
I typed in "privacy and information leak" keyword in Google Scholar.

What kind of article it is
Article of releasing new technology to prevent leakage of biometric features.

All the reasons that you think it is an academic article
This article is written by a team of professors and researchers in universities, so I believe this article is a servious academic article. 

How well it fits the ‘structure of an academic article’ that I described in my previous post
The structure of this article also quite well fit to an academic article, it has title, introduction of the authors, abstract, introduction, a review of relevent work, the content of the research and the theories behind the technology, resukt and discussion, conclusion and refernces.

How many references it has
It has 7 references.

How many citations it has
It has 4 citations.

Say whether you are interested in properly reading the article or not
I maybe interested in reading this article properly. The greater develop in technology, more likely that leakage of people's personal information happens. I do not want my personal information to expose, even we might have to provide our biometric information to government authorities, I hope all these information will not go through some untrusted servers and being collected for malicious purpose. If there is a technology to prevent privacy and biometric information leakage, I would like to know about it.
