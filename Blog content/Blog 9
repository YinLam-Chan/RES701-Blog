This week we considered what to do for our project, we need to find out what we are interested in IT, and what practical experience we want to get from doing the project, and then to narrow down the topic of what to do in the project.

I am interested in the web/software/application developing area in IT. I had learnt some web frameworks during my study in NMIT. I can try using these knowledges to build something. I also have some database knowledge. In the web developing field, a full stack development is so important. Creating a website for a real business usually involves connecting to the API backend and storing data in the database.

I believe web/software developing will be a good path to go on. Many things will be going to digital in the future, online stores may replace physical shops because it eliminate the rent expense and increase convenience for people, so I believe the demand of web developing will increase in the future. I would rather do something rather than research about it. I am a practical person, I believe my skills will get better only if I do it. Research about something is just a gather of information, and I probably cannot remember it without implementation, so I would prefer to build a working website as the final result of my project.

There are a few web frameworks I have learnt in NMIT, I think I would choose one which is quite pupular in the job market or the one which I am not familiar at so I can get more hand-on experience. I am planning to choose React web framework, because the tutor has told me this is a popular framework which people use nowsday, if I want to get a job easily, this is important that I know more about this framework.
